**VCard Manager** is a console application built with .NET to handle `.vcf` files containing vCards. Each vCard typically stores contact information such as full name, phone number, and email address. This application allows you to display, add, search, delete, and export contacts in an intuitive command-line interface using the **Spectre.Console** library.
